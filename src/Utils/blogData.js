            <p>Pizza is one of the most beloved dishes around the world, but making the perfect pizza at home can be a challenge. The secret lies not just in the toppings, but in the dough and the sauce.</p>
            <h3>The Dough</h3>
            <p>The foundation of any great pizza is the dough. Using high-quality flour, fresh yeast, and allowing the dough to ferment for at least 24 hours makes a huge difference in texture and flavor.</p>
            <h3>The Sauce</h3>
            <p>San Marzano tomatoes are the gold standard for pizza sauce. They are sweet, less acidic, and have a rich tomato flavor that doesn't need much seasoning.</p>
            <h3>The Cheese</h3>
            <p>Fresh mozzarella is a must. Avoid pre-shredded cheese as it often contains anti-caking agents that prevent it from melting properly.</p>
